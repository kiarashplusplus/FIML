      Your stock portfolio gained 8% last year. Congratulations! 🎉
      
      But wait... inflation was 3%.
      
      Did you really make 8%? Or did you make 5%?
      
      **The answer matters more than you think!**
      
      Understanding the difference between **nominal returns** (what you see) and **real returns** (what you actually gain in purchasing power) is crucial for long-term investing success.

  - type: explanation
    title: "Nominal vs Real Returns"
    content: |
      **Nominal Return:**
      - What your account statement shows
      - The percentage your money grew
      - Example: $10,000 → $10,800 = 8% nominal return
      
      **Real Return:**
      - What you actually gained in purchasing power
      - Nominal return minus inflation
      - Example: 8% nominal - 3% inflation = 5% real return
      
      **Why It Matters:**
      
      Year 1: You have $10,000
      Year 2: You have $10,800 (+8%)
      
      But if inflation was 3%:
      - That TV you wanted now costs $1,030 (was $1,000)
      - Your groceries cost $103 (were $100)
      - Everything is 3% more expensive!
      
      Your $10,800 buys what $10,485 would have bought last year.
      
      **Real return = 5%, not 8%**
      
      **The Formula:**
      Real Return ≈ Nominal Return - Inflation Rate
      
      (Technically: Real Return = ((1 + Nominal) / (1 + Inflation)) - 1, but the simple formula is close enough for most purposes)

      **The Silent Wealth Destroyer:**
      
      At 3% inflation, your money loses half its purchasing power in 24 years!
      
      **Historical Reality:**
      - Average inflation (1926-2023): ~3% per year
      - Some periods much higher (1970s: 7%+ average)
      - Some periods lower (2010s: 1-2% average)
      
      **Stock Returns vs Inflation:**
      
      Historically (since 1926):
      - Stocks: ~10% nominal return
      - Inflation: ~3% average
      - Real stock return: ~7% per year
      
      **That 7% real return is what actually grows your wealth!**
      
      **The Retirement Trap:**
      
      Many retirees think: "I'll need $50,000/year to live comfortably."
      
      But in 20 years at 3% inflation:
      - You'll need $90,306/year for the same lifestyle!
      - Your nest egg must keep growing, not just preserve
      
      This is why "safe" investments that don't beat inflation actually make you poorer over time.

      Let's calculate real returns using actual market data:

      Notice how:
      - Nominal returns look impressive
      - Real returns tell the true story
      - Some "gains" were actually losses after inflation
      
      Always think in real terms for long-term decisions!

    title: "Inflation Hedges and Strategies"
    content: |
      **Assets That Fight Inflation:**
      
      1. **Stocks** ✅
         - Companies can raise prices
         - Earnings grow with inflation
         - Best long-term inflation hedge
      
      2. **Real Estate** ✅
         - Rents increase with inflation
         - Property values rise
         - Leverage amplifies returns
      
      3. **TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)** ✅
         - Principal adjusts with CPI
         - Guaranteed real return
         - Government-backed
      
      4. **Commodities** ⚠️
         - Gold, oil, etc.
         - Volatile
         - Sometimes hedge, sometimes don't
      
      **Assets That Lose to Inflation:**
      
      1. **Cash** ❌
         - Loses 3% per year in purchasing power
         - Only for emergency fund and short-term needs
      
      2. **Bonds (non-inflation adjusted)** ⚠️
         - Fixed payments lose purchasing power
         - Okay for diversification, not inflation protection
      
      3. **Fixed Annuities** ❌
         - Fixed payments eroded by inflation
         - Consider inflation-adjusted annuities instead
      
      **Your Strategy:**
      - Young investors: Mostly stocks (best inflation hedge)
      - Moderate investors: Stocks + TIPS + real estate
      - Retirees: Balanced portfolio with inflation protection
      - Everyone: NEVER keep long-term savings in cash!

      Volume Indicators:
      
      High volume (>1M shares/day):
      - Easy to trade
      - Narrow spreads
      - Quick execution
      
      Low volume (<100K shares/day):
      - Hard to trade
      - Wide spreads
      - Price slippage
      
      Why It Matters:
      
      Low liquidity means you might:
      - Pay more than you should
      - Can't sell when you want
      - Move the price against yourself
      
      Rule: Beginners stick to stocks with >1M daily volume

      Imagine trying to sell a rare collectible vs. selling cash. Cash is easy to trade—everyone 
      wants it! That's high liquidity. A rare collectible might take weeks to find a buyer. That's low liquidity.
      
      In the stock market, **volume** and **liquidity** tell you how easy it is to trade a stock 
      without affecting its price.
      
      **Volume** = Number of shares traded in a period
      **Liquidity** = How easily you can buy/sell without moving the price

      **Volume Analysis:**

      **What this means:**
      - High volume = More buyers and sellers = Easier to trade
      - Low volume = Fewer participants = Harder to trade at good prices

      **📊 Why Volume Matters:**
      
      **1. Price Impact**
      - High-volume stock: You can buy 1,000 shares without moving the price
      - Low-volume stock: Buying 1,000 shares might push the price up 5%
      
      **2. Bid-Ask Spread**
      - High volume → Narrow spread → Lower trading costs
      - Low volume → Wide spread → Higher trading costs
      
      **3. Trade Execution**
      - High volume → Orders fill quickly at expected prices
      - Low volume → Orders may partially fill or take hours/days
      
      **Volume Categories:**
      - 🔥 **High Volume**: > 5 million shares/day (large caps like AAPL, TSLA)
      - 📊 **Medium Volume**: 1-5 million shares/day (mid caps)
      - 📉 **Low Volume**: < 1 million shares/day (small caps, risky for large trades)

      **🚨 Volume Spikes Signal Activity**
      
      Volume can reveal important market events:
      
      **📈 Volume > Average:**
      - Earnings announcement
      - Major news event
      - Institutional buying/selling
      - Breakout or breakdown
      
      **📉 Volume < Average:**
      - Holiday periods
      - Low interest/indecision
      - Potential reversal coming
      
      **Example:**
      A stock typically trades 2M shares/day.
      Today it's trading 10M shares (5x normal).
      → Something significant is happening! Check the news.

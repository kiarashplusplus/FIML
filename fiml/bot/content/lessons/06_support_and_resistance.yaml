learning_objectives:
  - Identify support levels
  - Identify resistance levels
  - Use them for trading decisions

sections:
  - type: introduction
    content: |
      Support = price floor (buyers step in)
      Resistance = price ceiling (sellers step in)
      
      These are psychological price levels

  - type: explanation
    content: |
      Support:
      Price level where buying pressure prevents further decline
      
      Example: Stock bounces at $50 three times
      → $50 is support
      
      Resistance:
      Price level where selling pressure prevents further rise
      
      Example: Stock tops out at $70 three times
      → $70 is resistance
      
      How to Use:
      
      - Buy near support (lower risk)
      - Sell near resistance (take profits)
      - If support breaks → price drops further
      - If resistance breaks → price rises further
      
      Role Reversal:
      Broken resistance becomes new support
      Broken support becomes new resistance

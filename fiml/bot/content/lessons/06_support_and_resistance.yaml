      Imagine a ball bouncing in a room. It hits the floor (support) and bounces up. 
      It hits the ceiling (resistance) and bounces down. Stock prices behave similarly!
      
      **Support** = A price level where buying interest is strong enough to prevent further decline
      **Resistance** = A price level where selling pressure is strong enough to prevent further rise
      
      These levels form because of:
      - Trader psychology (fear and greed)
      - Historical price memory
      - Round numbers (psychological barriers)
      - Previous highs and lows

      **📊 Support Levels:**
      
      A support level is a price floor where the stock tends to bounce back up.
      
      **Why Support Forms:**
      1. **Buyers Remember**: "Last time it hit $100, it bounced. I'll buy at $100 again!"
      2. **Stop Losses**: Short sellers place protective orders around support
      3. **Value Perception**: "At $100, this stock is a bargain"
      
      **Identifying Support:**
      - Look for price levels where stock bounced multiple times
      - Previous lows often become support
      - Round numbers ($100, $50, $25)
      - Moving averages (50-day, 200-day)
      
      **Example:**
      A stock drops from $150 to $130 (bounces), then $160 to $130 (bounces again).
      → $130 is a support level.
      
      **⚠️ Support Breaks:**
      If price falls THROUGH support (with high volume), it often continues falling.
      Old support becomes new resistance!

      **📊 Resistance Levels:**
      
      A resistance level is a price ceiling where selling pressure stops upward movement.
      
      **Why Resistance Forms:**
      1. **Profit Taking**: "I bought at $80, now at $120 I'll sell and take profits"
      2. **Bag Holders**: "I bought at $120 and it fell. If it gets back to $120, I'm selling!"
      3. **Fear Patterns**: Previous highs create fear of rejection
      
      **Identifying Resistance:**
      - Previous highs where price reversed
      - Round numbers ($100, $150, $200)
      - Failed breakout attempts
      - Moving average resistance
      
      **Example:**
      Stock rises from $80 to $100 (rejected), then $90 to $100 (rejected again).
      → $100 is a resistance level.
      
      **✅ Resistance Breaks:**
      When price breaks THROUGH resistance (with high volume):
      - Old resistance becomes new support
      - Often leads to strong continuation
      - Called a "breakout"

      **Key Insight:**
      Watch these levels! A bounce off support or rejection at resistance confirms 
      the level's strength. A break through (with volume) signals a significant move.

      **🎯 Trading with Support & Resistance:**
      
      **Strategy 1: Bounce Plays**
      - Stock approaches support → Buy
      - Stock approaches resistance → Sell/Short
      - Risk: Support/resistance can break!
      
      **Strategy 2: Breakout Plays**
      - Stock breaks ABOVE resistance → Buy (new uptrend)
      - Stock breaks BELOW support → Sell/Short (new downtrend)
      - Confirm with high volume!
      
      **Strategy 3: Failed Breaks (Fakeouts)**
      - Stock breaks resistance but immediately falls back → Short signal
      - Stock breaks support but immediately recovers → Buy signal
      - Common trap for novice traders!
      
      **⚠️ Risk Management:**
      - Always use stop losses below support (for longs)
      - Always use stop losses above resistance (for shorts)
      - Wait for confirmation (volume, multiple candle closes)
      - Beware of "false breakouts"

      🎯 **Key Takeaways:**
      
      1. **Support** = Price floor where buying emerges
      2. **Resistance** = Price ceiling where selling emerges
      3. Multiple bounces strengthen support/resistance
      4. Breaks through S/R levels (with volume) signal big moves
      5. Old support becomes new resistance (and vice versa)
      
      💡 **Pro Tips:**
      - Support and resistance are zones, not exact prices
      - Volume confirms the strength of breaks
      - The more times a level is tested, the stronger it is
      - Round numbers (psychologically important) often act as S/R

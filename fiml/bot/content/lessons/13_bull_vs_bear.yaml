      **Why "Bull" and "Bear"?**
      
      🐂 **Bull** = Attacks by thrusting horns UPWARD
      → Bull Market = Prices rising
      
      🐻 **Bear** = Attacks by swiping paws DOWNWARD
      → Bear Market = Prices falling
      
      **Official Definitions:**
      - **Bull Market**: 20%+ rise from recent low
      - **Bear Market**: 20%+ fall from recent high
      - **Correction**: 10-20% fall (normal, not a bear market)
      
      Understanding which market you're in determines your strategy!

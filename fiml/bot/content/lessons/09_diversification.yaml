      **The Diversification Principle:**
      
      Imagine you own 10 different businesses:
      - 3 do amazing (3x return)
      - 4 do okay (1.2x return)
      - 2 do poorly (0.5x return)
      - 1 fails completely (0x return)
      
      Overall portfolio: Still profitable!
      
      Now imagine you own just ONE business and it fails: 100% loss.
      
      **Diversification** = Spreading investments across different assets to reduce risk.
      
      "Don't put all your eggs in one basket" - The oldest wisdom in investing!

      **📊 Why Diversification Works:**
      
      **Reduces Specific Risk:**
      - Company-specific risks (CEO resignation, product failure, scandal)
      - Industry risks (regulatory changes, tech disruption)
      - Geographic risks (local economic problems)
      
      **Example:**
      - 100% in one stock → If it drops 50%, you're down 50%
      - 10% in each of 10 stocks → If one drops 50%, you're only down 5%
      
      **The Math of Diversification:**
      ```
      1 stock = 100% concentration = Maximum risk
      5 stocks = 20% each = High risk
      10 stocks = 10% each = Moderate risk
      20 stocks = 5% each = Lower risk
      50+ stocks = ~2% each = Diminishing returns (over-diversified)
      ```
      
      **⚠️ Important:** Diversification reduces risk, but also reduces maximum gains!
      - All money in one winner = 10x return
      - Equal split across 10 stocks, one is 10x = Only 1.9x total return

      **🎯 Dimensions of Diversification:**
      
      **1. Across Companies**
      Own multiple stocks, not just one
      Minimum: 8-10 stocks
      Optimal: 15-25 stocks
      
      **2. Across Sectors**
      Don't own 10 tech stocks and call it diversified!
      
      ✅ **11 Market Sectors:**
      - Technology (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL)
      - Healthcare (JNJ, PFE, UNH)
      - Financials (JPM, BAC, V)
      - Consumer Discretionary (AMZN, TSLA, HD)
      - Consumer Staples (PG, KO, WMT)
      - Energy (XOM, CVX, COP)
      - Industrials (BA, CAT, GE)
      - Materials (NEM, FCX, LIN)
      - Real Estate (AMT, PLD, SPG)
      - Utilities (NEE, DUK, SO)
      - Communications (T, VZ, DIS)
      
      **Balanced Portfolio:**
      Spread across 4-6 different sectors
      
      **3. Across Market Caps**
      - 60-70%: Large-cap (stability)
      - 20-30%: Mid-cap (growth)
      - 5-10%: Small-cap (high growth/risk)
      
      **4. Across Asset Classes**
      - Stocks (growth)
      - Bonds (stability, income)
      - Real Estate (inflation hedge)
      - Commodities (diversification)
      - Cash (opportunity fund)

      **⚠️ Diversification Mistakes:**
      
      **Mistake #1: False Diversification**
      - Owning AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NVDA = All tech = Not diversified!
      - Correlation matters: If they all move together, no protection
      
      **Mistake #2: Over-Diversification**
      - Owning 100 stocks = Can't possibly track them all
      - Dilutes returns from your best ideas
      - Creates an expensive index fund
      - "Diworsification"
      
      **Mistake #3: Under-Diversification**
      - 3-4 stocks = One bad quarter destroys portfolio
      - No protection from company-specific risk
      
      **Mistake #4: Ignoring Correlation**
      - All growth stocks crash together in bear markets
      - All oil stocks move with oil prices
      - Need true independence
      
      **✅ Sweet Spot:**
      15-25 stocks across 5-7 sectors with low correlation

      1. **Diversification reduces portfolio volatility and risk**
      2. Own 15-25 stocks across multiple sectors
      3. Don't confuse # of stocks with true diversification

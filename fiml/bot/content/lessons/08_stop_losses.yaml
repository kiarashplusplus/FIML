      Imagine driving without brakes. Terrifying, right? That's trading without stop losses!
      
      A **stop-loss order** is an automatic sell order that triggers when a stock drops to 
      a specified price. It's your emergency brake—protecting you from catastrophic losses.
      
      **Why crucial:**
      - Limits losses to predetermined amounts
      - Removes emotion from loss-taking
      - Protects capital for future opportunities
      - Lets you sleep at night!
      
      **Without stop losses:** A 10% loss requires an 11% gain to recover.  
      A 50% loss requires a 100% gain to recover!

      **📊 Types of Stop-Loss Orders:**
      
      **1. Fixed-Price Stop Loss**
      - Set at specific price: "Sell if drops to $45"
      - Simple and predictable
      - Best for: Clear support levels
      
      **Example:**
      Buy at $50, set stop at $47 (6% loss max)
      
      **2. Percentage Stop Loss**
      - Set as % below entry: "Sell if drops 8%"
      - Automatically adjusts with position size
      - Best for: Consistent risk management
      
      **Example:**
      Buy at $100, set 8% stop → Triggers at $92
      
      **3. Trailing Stop Loss**
      - Moves UP with price, never down
      - Locks in profits as stock rises
      - Best for: Trending stocks
      
      **Example:**
      - Buy at $50, set 10% trailing stop (triggers at $45)
      - Stock rises to $60 → stop moves to $54 (10% below $60)
      - Stock rises to $70 → stop moves to $63
      - If stock falls from $70 to $63 → stop triggers, you exit with profit!
      
      **4. Time-Based Stop**
      - Exit after a set time if not profitable
      - Best for: Swing trades with thesis deadlines

      **🎯 Where to Place Stop Losses:**
      
      **1. Below Support Levels**
      - Give stock room to breathe
      - Avoid getting "shaken out" by normal volatility
      - Example: Support at $48, place stop at $47
      
      **2. Percentage-Based**
      - 5-8%: Tight for low-volatility stocks
      - 8-12%: Moderate for average stocks
      - 12-20%: Wide for volatile growth stocks
      
      **3. ATR (Average True Range)**
      - Use 2x ATR below entry (advanced)
      - Adapts to stock's normal volatility
      
      **4. Round Numbers**
      - Avoid exact round numbers ($50, $100)
      - Many traders put stops there
      - Use $49.50 or $50.50 instead
      
      **⚠️ Too Tight:**
      Stop at $99 when you buy at $100 = You'll get stopped out by noise
      
      **⚠️ Too Loose:**
      Stop at $80 when you buy at $100 = 20% loss violates 1-2% risk rule!

      **🚨 Common Stop-Loss Mistakes:**
      
      **Mistake #1: No Stop Loss**
      "I'll just hold and wait for it to come back"
      → Result: -90% losses, capital tied up for years
      
      **Mistake #2: Moving Stop Loss Down**
      "It'll bounce back, I'll lower my stop"
      → Result: Turning small loss into disaster
      
      **Mistake #3: Stop Too Tight**
      "I'll use a 2% stop on a volatile stock"
      → Result: Stopped out by normal fluctuation, then stock rallies
      
      **Mistake #4: Mental Stop Loss**
      "I don't need to set it, I'll sell manually"
      → Result: Emotion takes over, you don't sell, massive loss
      
      **Mistake #5: Same Stop for All Stocks**
      "I always use 10% stops"
      → Result: Doesn't account for different volatilities
      
      **✅ Best Practices:**
      - ALWAYS set the stop when entering the trade
      - Never move stop DOWN (only up as profit grows)
      - Use appropriate stop width for volatility
      - Accept stop-outs as cost of doing business
      - Review stopped trades to improve entries

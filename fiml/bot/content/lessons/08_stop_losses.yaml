      Stop-loss = automatic sell order if price drops
      
      Purpose: Limit losses before they get big

      How It Works:
      
      Buy stock at $100
      Set stop-loss at $90
      
      If price drops to $90 → auto-sells
      Max loss: 10%
      
      Types:
      
      Fixed Percentage:
      - 7-10% below buy price
      - Simple, consistent
      
      Technical Level:
      - Below support
      - Below moving average
      
      Trailing Stop:
      - Follows price up
      - Locks in profits
      
      Example: 10% trailing stop
      Buy at $100, stop at $90
      Price rises to $120 → stop moves to $108
      Price drops to $108 → sells (locked in 8% gain)

      1. Stop-loss limits downside
      2. Set 7-10% below entry
      3. Don't move stops lower (discipline!)
      4. Trailing stops lock profits
      5. Better to exit early than lose big

      Stock prices zigzag up and down. How do you see the overall trend through the noise?
      
      **Moving Average (MA)** = The average price over a specific number of days
      
      Think of it like smoothing out a bumpy road:
      - Daily prices = bumpy ride
      - Moving average = smooth highway showing direction
      
      Most important MAs:
      - **50-day MA**: Short/medium-term trend
      - **200-day MA**: Long-term trend
      
      **Golden Cross** = 50-day crosses ABOVE 200-day (bullish!)
      **Death Cross** = 50-day crosses BELOW 200-day (bearish!)

      **Position Relative to MAs:**
      - Price vs 50-day: {vs_50_day}
      - Price vs 200-day: {vs_200_day}
      
      **Interpretation:**
      Price above both MAs = Strong uptrend
      Price below both MAs = Strong downtrend
      Price between MAs = Transitional period

      **📊 MA Strategies:**
      
      **1. Trend Identification**
      - Price > MA = Uptrend
      - Price < MA = Downtrend
      - Price crossing MA = Trend change
      
      **2. Support/Resistance**
      - In uptrends: MA acts as support
      - In downtrends: MA acts as resistance
      - Bounces off MA = good entry points
      
      **3. Golden Cross (Bullish)**
      - 50-day crosses above 200-day
      - Signals shift to uptrend
      - Historical accuracy: ~70%
      - Example: March 2009 (start of bull market)
      
      **4. Death Cross (Bearish)**
      - 50-day crosses below 200-day
      - Signals shift to downtrend
      - Warning sign to reduce exposure
      - Example: January 2008 (before crash)
      
      **⚠️ Limitations:**
      - Lagging indicator (shows what happened)
      - Many false signals in choppy markets
      - Works best in strong trends
      - Combine with other indicators

      1. **Moving averages smooth price action** to reveal trends
      2. 50-day MA = medium-term, 200-day MA = long-term
      3. Golden Cross (50 > 200) = bullish signal
      4. Death Cross (50 < 200) = bearish signal
      5. MAs act as support in uptrends, resistance in downtrends

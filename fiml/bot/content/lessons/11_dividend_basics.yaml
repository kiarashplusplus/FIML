      What if your stocks paid you cash every quarter just for owning them? That's dividends!
      
      **Dividend** = A portion of company profits paid to shareholders
      
      Think of it like rent from real estate:
      - You own the property (stock)
      - It generates income (dividends)
      - You can reinvest or spend the income
      - The property might also appreciate in value
      
      **Two ways to profit from stocks:**
      1. Capital gains (stock price goes up)
      2. Dividends (regular cash payments)

      **Live Example: {symbol}**
      
      Current Price: ${price}
      Annual Dividend: ${annual_dividend}
      Dividend Yield: {dividend_yield}%
      
      **What this means:**
      If you own 100 shares at ${price}:
      - Investment: ${total_investment}
      - Annual dividend income: ${annual_income}
      - Quarterly payment: ${quarterly_payment}
      
      Plus, you still own the stock which may appreciate!

      **📊 Understanding Dividend Yield:**
      
      **Formula:** Dividend Yield = (Annual Dividend ÷ Price) × 100%
      
      **Example:**
      - Stock Price: $100
      - Annual Dividend: $4
      - Yield: 4%
      
      **Yield Categories:**
      - 🟢 **High Yield** (> 4%): More income, but often slower growth
      - 🟡 **Medium Yield** (2-4%): Balanced income and growth
      - 🟠 **Low Yield** (< 2%): More growth-focused
      - ⚫ **No Dividend** (0%): All growth, no income (like AMZN, GOOGL)
      
      **⚠️ Dividend Trap:**
      Super high yields (> 8%) can be dangerous!
      - May indicate company in trouble
      - Dividend might be cut
      - Stock price falling faster than dividend
      
      **Example of a Trap:**
      - Stock was $100, dividend $4 (4% yield)
      - Stock falls to $50 (company struggling)
      - Dividend still $4 → Now 8% yield!
      - Looks attractive, but dividend likely to be cut

      **🎯 Dividend Aristocrats:**
      
      **Who are they?**
      Companies that have increased dividends for 25+ consecutive years
      
      **Why it matters:**
      - Demonstrates financial stability
      - Management committed to shareholders
      - Survived multiple recessions
      - Quality businesses
      
      **Examples of Dividend Aristocrats:**
      - Coca-Cola (KO): 60+ years
      - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): 60+ years
      - Procter & Gamble (PG): 60+ years
      - 3M (MMM): 60+ years
      
      **Dividend Growth Strategy:**
      Instead of chasing high yields, buy stocks with:
      - Moderate current yield (2-3%)
      - Strong dividend growth history (8-10% per year)
      - Sustainable payout ratio (< 60%)
      
      **Power of Dividend Growth:**
      Buy at 3% yield, dividend grows 8% annually:
      - Year 5: 4.4% yield on your original investment
      - Year 10: 6.5% yield
      - Year 20: 14% yield!

      🎯 **Key Takeaways:**
      
      1. **Dividends** = Regular cash payments from company profits
      2. **Dividend Yield** = Annual dividend ÷ stock price
      3. High yields (> 8%) may be traps—investigate before buying
      4. Dividend Aristocrats = 25+ years of increases
      5. Reinvesting dividends compounds wealth over time
      
      💡 **Dividend Reinvestment (DRIP):**
      Automatically use dividends to buy more shares
      → Compounds returns over decades
      → $10,000 at 7% total return for 30 years:
         - No DRIP: ~$76,000
         - With DRIP: ~$100,000

    title: "Step 1: Define Your Goals"
    content: |
      **Without clear goals, you're just gambling.**
      
      **The Goal Framework:**
      
      1. **What are you saving for?**
         - Retirement (most people)
         - House down payment (5-10 years)
         - Child's education (10-18 years)
         - Financial independence (varies)
      
      2. **When do you need the money?**
         - < 3 years: NOT for stocks (too risky)
         - 3-10 years: Balanced approach (60/40 stocks/bonds)
         - 10+ years: Aggressive stocks (80-100%)
      
      3. **How much do you need?**
         - Retirement: 25-30x annual expenses (4% rule)
         - House: Down payment + closing costs
         - Education: $100K-$300K+ per child
      
      **Example Goals:**
      
      Sarah, age 30:
      - Goal 1: Retire at 60 with $50,000/year income
        * Need: $1.25M ($50K × 25)
        * Timeline: 30 years
        * Strategy: Aggressive growth (90% stocks)
      
      - Goal 2: House down payment in 7 years
        * Need: $80,000
        * Timeline: 7 years
        * Strategy: Moderate (60% stocks, 40% bonds)
      
      **Your Turn:**
      Write down 1-3 specific goals with dollar amounts and timelines!

    title: "Step 2: Assess Your Risk Tolerance"
    content: |
      **Two types of risk tolerance:**
      
      1. **Ability to take risk:**
         - Long time horizon = high ability
         - Short time horizon = low ability
         - Stable job + emergency fund = higher ability
         - Unstable income = lower ability
      
      2. **Willingness to take risk:**
         - Can you sleep at night if portfolio drops 30%?
         - Would you panic sell or buy more?
         - How did you feel in March 2020 crash?
      
      **The Acid Test:**
      
      Imagine your $100,000 portfolio drops to $70,000 tomorrow.
      
      - "I'd panic and sell everything" → Conservative (40% stocks)
      - "I'd be worried but hold" → Moderate (60% stocks)
      - "I'd buy more!" → Aggressive (80%+ stocks)
      
      **Age-Based Rule of Thumb:**
      
      Stock allocation = 110 - your age
      - Age 25: 85% stocks
      - Age 40: 70% stocks
      - Age 65: 45% stocks
      
      But adjust based on personal risk tolerance!
      
      **Reality Check:**
      Historically, stocks have recovered from every crash. But YOU have to survive the emotional rollercoaster to benefit!

    title: "Step 3: Build Your Asset Allocation"
    content: |
      **The Most Important Decision:**
      
      Asset allocation determines 90%+ of your returns!
      
      **The Basic Allocations:**
      
      **Aggressive (80-100% stocks):**
      - Who: Young investors (20s-30s), long timeline, high risk tolerance
      - Example: 90% Total Stock Market, 10% Bonds
      - Expected return: ~9% per year
      - Volatility: High (30-50% drops possible)
      
      **Moderate (60% stocks, 40% bonds):**
      - Who: Middle-age (40s-50s), medium timeline, moderate risk
      - Example: 60% Total Stock, 40% Total Bond
      - Expected return: ~7% per year
      - Volatility: Medium (20-30% drops possible)
      
      **Conservative (30-40% stocks):**
      - Who: Near/in retirement, low risk tolerance
      - Example: 40% Total Stock, 60% Total Bond
      - Expected return: ~5% per year
      - Volatility: Low (10-20% drops possible)
      
      **The Three-Fund Portfolio (Simple & Effective):**
      
      1. **US Total Stock Market** (VTI) - 60%
      2. **International Stocks** (VXUS) - 20%
      3. **Total Bond Market** (BND) - 20%
      
      That's it! This beats 80%+ of active investors.
      
      **Diversification Within Stocks:**
      - 70-80% US stocks
      - 20-30% international stocks
      - Consider small-cap tilt (10-20%)
      
      **Your Action:**
      Choose your target allocation based on goals and risk tolerance!

    title: "Step 4: Implement and Rebalance"
    content: |
      **Getting Started:**
      
      1. **Emergency Fund First!**
         - 3-6 months expenses in savings
         - NOT invested—needs to be liquid
      
      2. **Max Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
         - 401(k) up to employer match (free money!)
         - Then Roth IRA ($7,000/year)
         - Then max 401(k) ($23,000/year)
         - Then taxable brokerage
      
      3. **Automate Everything:**
         - Set up automatic transfers
         - Enable dividend reinvestment
         - Dollar-cost average consistently
      
      **Rebalancing Strategy:**
      
      Over time, winners grow and allocation drifts:
      
      Start: 80% stocks, 20% bonds
      After 2 years: 85% stocks, 15% bonds (stocks outperformed)
      
      **Rebalancing Options:**
      
      1. **Calendar-based:**
         - Rebalance every 6-12 months
         - Simple, easy to remember
      
      2. **Threshold-based:**
         - Rebalance when allocation drifts 5%+
         - More tax-efficient
         - Example: Rebalance when stocks hit 85% (started at 80%)
      
      3. **New Money:**
         - Direct new investments to underweight assets
         - Most tax-efficient
         - Example: Stocks grew to 85%? Invest next 3 months' savings in bonds
      
      **How to Rebalance:**
      - In tax-advantaged accounts: Sell winners, buy losers (no tax)
      - In taxable accounts: Use new money when possible
      
      **Why Rebalance:**
      - Maintains your risk level
      - Forces "buy low, sell high" discipline
      - Prevents overconcentration

    title: "Step 5: Write Your Investment Policy Statement"
    content: |
      **Your Contract with Future You:**
      
      An Investment Policy Statement (IPS) prevents emotional decisions during market chaos.
      
      **Essential Components:**
      
      **1. Goals & Timeline:**
      "I am investing for retirement in 30 years, targeting $1.5M in today's dollars."
      
      **2. Asset Allocation:**
      "Target: 80% stocks (60% US, 20% international), 20% bonds"
      
      **3. Rebalancing Rules:**
      "Rebalance annually each January, or when any allocation drifts 5%+ from target"
      
      **4. Contribution Plan:**
      "Contribute $1,000/month: $500 to 401(k), $500 to Roth IRA"
      
      **5. What I'll Do During a Crash:**
      "If market drops 20%+, I will INCREASE contributions if possible, not sell. Recessions are buying opportunities."
      
      **6. What I Won't Do:**
      "I will not: day trade, chase hot stocks, panic sell, try to time the market, check portfolio more than monthly"
      
      **7. Review Schedule:**
      "Review goals annually, update IPS every 5 years or after major life changes"
      
      **Sample Simple IPS:**
      
      ```
      Investment Policy Statement - John Doe
      
      Goal: Retire at 60 (25 years) with $2M
      Risk: Moderate (can handle 30% drops)
      
      Allocation:
      - 70% VTI (US Total Market)
      - 20% VXUS (International)
      - 10% BND (Bonds)
      
      Contributions: $2,000/month
      - $1,500 to 401(k)
      - $500 to Roth IRA
      
      Rebalance: Annually in January
      
      During market crashes: Stay the course. Increase contributions if possible.
      
      Next review: January [next year]
      ```
      
      **Your Action:**
      Write your IPS today! Keep it simple, then stick to it.

      type: multiple_choice
      text: "Using the 4% rule, if you need $60,000/year in retirement, what's your target nest egg?"
      options:
        - "$600,000"
        - "$1,000,000"
        - "$1,500,000"
        - "$2,000,000"
      correct: 2
      explanation: "The 4% rule suggests multiplying your annual needs by 25: $60,000 × 25 = $1,500,000. This assumes you can safely withdraw 4% per year without running out of money in a 30-year retirement."

    - id: asset_allocation_by_age
      type: multiple_choice
      text: "You're 35 years old saving for retirement at 65. Which allocation is most appropriate?"
      options:
        - "100% bonds (very safe)"
        - "50% stocks, 50% bonds"
        - "80% stocks, 20% bonds"
        - "100% stocks (maximum growth)"
      correct: 2
      explanation: "With a 30-year timeline, 80% stocks provides growth potential while 20% bonds adds some stability. The '110 - age' rule suggests 75% stocks (110 - 35 = 75), so 80% is appropriate for an aggressive investor with high risk tolerance."

    - id: rebalancing_concept
      type: true_false
      text: "True or False: Rebalancing means selling winners and buying losers to maintain your target allocation."
      correct: true
      explanation: "True! Rebalancing enforces 'buy low, sell high' discipline. If stocks outperform and grow from 80% to 90% of your portfolio, you sell some stocks and buy bonds to get back to your 80/20 target."

      correct: 2
      explanation: "The three-fund portfolio consists of: US Total Stock Market (VTI), International Stocks (VXUS), and Total Bond Market (BND). Individual stocks aren't included—the strategy uses broad index funds for maximum diversification."

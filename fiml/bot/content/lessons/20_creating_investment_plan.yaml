      Step 1: Define Goals
      
      - Retirement (25-30x annual expenses)
      - House down payment
      - Financial independence
      
      Timeline determines strategy:
      - <3 years: avoid stocks
      - 3-10 years: 60% stocks
      - 10+ years: 80-100% stocks
      
      Step 2: Assess Risk
      
      Can you handle 30% portfolio drop?
      - Yes + buy more → 80%+ stocks
      - Worried but hold → 60% stocks
      - Panic sell → 40% stocks
      
      Step 3: Asset Allocation
      
      Simple 3-fund portfolio:
      - 60% US Total Market (VTI)
      - 20% International (VXUS)
      - 20% Bonds (BND)
      
      Step 4: Automate
      
      - Emergency fund first (3-6 months)
      - Max 401(k) match
      - Max Roth IRA ($7,000)
      - Then taxable
      
      Step 5: Rebalance
      
      - Annually OR
      - When drift >5%
      - Use new money when possible

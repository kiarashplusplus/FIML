      Income Statement:
      Shows profitability
      
      Revenue (sales)
      - Costs
      - Expenses
      = Net Income (profit)
      
      Balance Sheet:
      Shows financial position
      
      Assets = what company owns
      Liabilities = what company owes
      Equity = assets - liabilities
      
      Cash Flow:
      Shows cash movement
      
      Operating cash flow = most important
      Must be positive long-term
      
      Key Metrics:
      - Profit margin = net income ÷ revenue
      - Debt-to-equity = total debt ÷ equity
      - Current ratio = assets ÷ liabilities

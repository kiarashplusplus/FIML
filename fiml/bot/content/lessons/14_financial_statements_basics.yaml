      Every public company must publish financial statements quarterly. These are like 
      a company's report card—showing how healthy the business really is.
      
      **The Three Financial Statements:**
      
      1. **Income Statement** = Profitability (Did we make money?)
      2. **Balance Sheet** = Financial Health (What do we own vs. owe?)
      3. **Cash Flow Statement** = Liquidity (Where did money come from/go?)
      
      Think of a person's finances:
      - Income Statement = Monthly salary and expenses
      - Balance Sheet = Total assets (house, car) and debts (mortgage, loans)
      - Cash Flow = Actual cash in/out of bank account

      **📊 Income Statement (Profit & Loss):**
      
      Shows revenue, expenses, and profit over a period (quarter/year).
      
      **Key Components:**
      ```
      Revenue (Sales)                    $1,000,000
      - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)       - $400,000
      ==========================================
      Gross Profit                       $600,000
      - Operating Expenses               - $300,000
      ==========================================
      Operating Income (EBIT)            $300,000
      - Interest & Taxes                 - $80,000
      ==========================================
      Net Income (Bottom Line)           $220,000
      ```
      
      **What to Look For:**
      ✅ Revenue growth (comparing to prior quarters/years)
      ✅ Gross margin stable or improving (Gross Profit ÷ Revenue)
      ✅ Operating margin healthy (Operating Income ÷ Revenue)
      ✅ Net income growing
      
      🚩 **Red Flags:**
      - Revenue declining
      - Margins shrinking
      - Losses (negative net income)
      - One-time charges every quarter (suspicious!)

      **🏦 Balance Sheet (Snapshot):**
      
      Shows what the company owns (assets) and owes (liabilities) at a point in time.
      
      **Structure:**
      ```
      ASSETS = LIABILITIES + EQUITY
      
      Assets (What we own):
      - Current Assets              $500,000
        (Cash, inventory, receivables)
      - Long-term Assets            $800,000
        (Property, equipment, intangibles)
      Total Assets               $1,300,000
      
      Liabilities (What we owe):
      - Current Liabilities         $200,000
        (Payables, short-term debt)
      - Long-term Liabilities       $400,000
        (Long-term debt, pensions)
      Total Liabilities            $600,000
      
      Equity (Shareholders' ownership)
      - Shareholder Equity          $700,000
      ```
      
      **Key Ratios:**
      - **Current Ratio** = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities
        (Should be > 1.5 for safety)
      - **Debt-to-Equity** = Total Debt ÷ Equity
        (Lower is better, < 1.0 ideal for most companies)
      
      🚩 **Red Flags:**
      - Current ratio < 1 (can't pay short-term bills)
      - Debt-to-equity > 2 (too much leverage)
      - Declining assets
      - Growing liabilities faster than assets

      **💰 Cash Flow Statement:**
      
      Shows actual cash movement—where money came from and where it went.
      
      **Three Sections:**
      ```
      Operating Cash Flow (from business)     $250,000
      - Normal business operations
      - Most important section!
      
      Investing Cash Flow (assets)           -$100,000
      - Buying/selling property, equipment
      - Acquisitions
      
      Financing Cash Flow (debt/equity)      -$50,000
      - Taking/repaying loans
      - Issuing/buying back stock
      - Paying dividends
      
      =============================================
      Net Cash Change                         $100,000
      ```
      
      **Why Cash Flow Matters:**
      - **Profit ≠ Cash!** (Can show profit but run out of cash)
      - Operating cash flow should be positive
      - Should cover capital expenditures
      - Indicates real business health
      
      **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**
      FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures
      → Money available for dividends, buybacks, growth
      
      🚩 **Red Flags:**
      - Negative operating cash flow
      - FCF consistently negative
      - Cash burn rate too high
      - Net income positive but cash flow negative (earnings manipulation?)

      When people say "Apple is a bigger company than Tesla," what do they mean? How do we 
      measure a company's size in the stock market?
      
      **Market Capitalization (Market Cap)** is the total value of all a company's outstanding shares.
      
      **Formula:**
      Market Cap = Share Price × Total Shares Outstanding
      
      It tells you how much it would cost to buy the entire company at current prices.

      Current Price: ${price}
      Shares Outstanding: {shares_outstanding:,}
      
      **Market Cap: ${market_cap}**

      This means to buy every single share of {symbol} at current prices, 
      you'd need ${market_cap}!

      **📊 Market Cap Categories:**
      
      **🏢 Large-Cap (> $10 Billion)**
      - Examples: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google
      - Characteristics: Stable, established, widely owned
      - Pros: Lower risk, steady growth, liquid
      - Cons: Slower growth potential
      - Best for: Conservative investors, beginners
      
      **🏭 Mid-Cap ($2B - $10B)**
      - Examples: Square, Etsy, DocuSign
      - Characteristics: Growing companies, moderate risk
      - Pros: Growth potential, increasing stability
      - Cons: More volatile than large-caps
      - Best for: Balanced portfolios
      
      **🏪 Small-Cap ($300M - $2B)**
      - Examples: Many emerging tech companies
      - Characteristics: High growth potential, higher risk
      - Pros: Can multiply in value quickly
      - Cons: Volatile, less liquid, can fail
      - Best for: Risk-tolerant investors
      
      **🏠 Micro-Cap (< $300M)**
      - Examples: Penny stocks, startups

      **🎯 Common Misconceptions:**
      
      ❌ **WRONG:** "Stock A is $500 and Stock B is $50, so Stock A is bigger"
      ✅ **CORRECT:** Market cap determines size, not share price!
      
      **Example:**
      - Company A: $500/share × 1M shares = $500M market cap (small)
      - Company B: $50/share × 100M shares = $5B market cap (mid-cap, BIGGER)
      
      **Why This Matters:**
      Share price alone is meaningless. A $5 stock can be a large-cap if it has billions of 
      shares outstanding. A $500 stock can be a small-cap if it has few shares.
      
      **Investment Implications:**
      - Large-caps: Buy for stability and dividends
      - Mid-caps: Buy for balanced growth
      - Small-caps: Buy for high growth (with higher risk)
      - Micro-caps: Speculative only (most investors should avoid)

      🎯 **Key Takeaways:**
      
      1. **Market Cap** = Share Price × Shares Outstanding
      2. Market cap measures total company value, not share price
      3. Large-cap = Stable, Mid-cap = Balanced, Small-cap = Risky
      4. Beginners should focus on large-cap stocks first
      5. Diversify across market caps for balanced risk/reward
      
      💡 **Pro Tip:** A company's market cap can change daily as its stock price moves, 
      even if nothing else about the company changes!

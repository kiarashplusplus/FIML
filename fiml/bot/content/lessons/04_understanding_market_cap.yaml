      Market Cap = company's total value

      Example: $100/share × 10M shares = $1B market cap

      Size Categories:
      
      Large-Cap (>$10B):
      - Examples: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL
      - Lower risk, stable
      - Slower growth
      
      Mid-Cap ($2B-$10B):
      - Balanced risk/reward
      - Moderate growth
      - Less volatile than small-caps
      
      Small-Cap (<$2B):
      - Higher risk
      - Higher growth potential
      - More volatile
      
      Micro-Cap (<$300M):
      - Very risky
      - Can double or halve quickly
      - Avoid as beginner

      🎯 Remember:
      
      1. Market cap = price × shares outstanding
      2. Large-cap = safer, slower growth
      3. Small-cap = risky, faster growth
      4. Beginners: start with large-caps
      5. Diversify across cap sizes

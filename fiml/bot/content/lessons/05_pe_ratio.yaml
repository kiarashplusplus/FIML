      Imagine two restaurants for sale:
      - Restaurant A: Costs $1M, makes $100K/year profit → Takes 10 years to break even
      - Restaurant B: Costs $500K, makes $100K/year profit → Takes 5 years to break even
      
      Which is a better deal? Restaurant B! You're paying less for the same earnings.
      
      The **P/E Ratio** does the same thing for stocks—it tells you how many years of 
      earnings you're paying for when you buy a stock.
      
      **Formula:** P/E Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings Per Share (EPS)

      **Live Data for {symbol}:**
      
      Share Price: ${price}
      Earnings Per Share (EPS): ${eps}
      
      **P/E Ratio: {pe_ratio}**
      
      **What this means:**
      You're paying ${pe_ratio} for every $1 of annual earnings.
      
      Or: At current earnings, it would take {pe_ratio} years for the company to 
      earn back the stock's price.

      **📊 Interpreting P/E Ratios:**
      
      **🟢 Low P/E (< 15)**
      - **Potentially undervalued** or out of favor
      - May indicate value opportunity
      - Could also mean slow growth or problems
      - Examples: Mature industries (utilities, banks)
      
      **🟡 Fair P/E (15-25)**
      - Market average, **reasonably priced**
      - Neither cheap nor expensive
      - Most established companies
      
      **🟠 High P/E (25-40)**
      - **Growth expectations** priced in
      - Investors expect strong future earnings
      - Higher risk if growth doesn't materialize
      - Examples: Tech companies, growth stocks
      
      **🔴 Very High P/E (> 40)**
      - **Speculative** or extreme growth expectations
      - Can indicate overvaluation
      - High risk of correction
      - Examples: Hot IPOs, meme stocks
      
      **⚠️ Negative P/E**
      - Company is losing money
      - No P/E ratio (or shown as N/A)
      - Common for startups or turnarounds
      - High risk!

      **🎯 Using P/E for Comparison:**
      
      P/E ratios are most useful when comparing:
      
      **1. Similar Companies**
      ✅ Apple (P/E: 25) vs. Microsoft (P/E: 30)
      ❌ Apple (P/E: 25) vs. Ford (P/E: 8) → Different industries!
      
      **2. Company vs. Industry Average**
      - Tech industry average P/E: 25
      - Stock A P/E: 18 → Potentially undervalued
      - Stock B P/E: 40 → Potentially overvalued
      
      **3. Historical P/E**
      - Stock typically trades at P/E of 20
      - Currently at P/E of 12 → Worth investigating why
      - Currently at P/E of 35 → May be overheated
      
      **⚠️ P/E Limitations:**
      - Doesn't work for unprofitable companies
      - Can be manipulated by accounting
      - Ignores debt and growth rate
      - Industry context matters
      - Past earnings don't guarantee future

      🎯 **Key Takeaways:**
      
      1. **P/E Ratio** = Price ÷ Earnings Per Share
      2. Lower P/E can mean value opportunity (or problems)
      3. Higher P/E reflects growth expectations (or overvaluation)
      4. Compare P/E within the same industry
      5. Use P/E with other metrics—never in isolation
      
      💡 **Remember:** A "good" P/E depends on the industry, growth rate, and market 
      conditions. There's no universal rule!

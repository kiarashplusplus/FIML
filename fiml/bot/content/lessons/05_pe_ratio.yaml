      P/E Ratio = Price-to-Earnings
      
      Shows how much you pay for $1 of earnings
      
      Formula: Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share

      How to Read P/E:
      
      Low P/E (< 15):
      - Potentially undervalued
      - Slower growth expected
      - Value stock
      
      Medium P/E (15-25):
      - Fairly valued
      - Average market valuation
      
      High P/E (> 25):
      - Potentially overvalued
      - High growth expected
      - Growth stock
      
      Example:
      Stock A: $100, EPS $5 → P/E = 20
      Stock B: $50, EPS $1 → P/E = 50
      
      Stock B is "more expensive" per dollar of earnings

      🎯 Remember:
      
      1. P/E = price ÷ earnings per share
      2. Lower P/E = cheaper relative to earnings
      3. Compare P/E within same industry
      4. High P/E = growth expectations
      5. Consider P/E with other metrics

      Two ways to buy/sell stocks:
      
      Market Order: "Buy NOW at current price"
      Limit Order: "Only buy if price reaches $X"

      Market Order:
      ✅ Executes immediately
      ✅ Simple and fast
      ❌ No price control
      ❌ Can get slippage
      
      Use when: You need shares NOW
      
      Limit Order:
      ✅ Control exact price
      ✅ No surprises
      ❌ May never execute
      ❌ Requires patience
      
      Use when: Price matters more than timing
      
      Example:
      Stock at $100
      
      Market buy → pays ~$100.05 (instant)
      Limit buy at $99 → waits... only executes if price drops

      🎯 Remember:
      
      1. Market = speed, limit = price control
      2. Use market for liquid stocks during trading hours
      3. Use limit for volatile stocks
      4. NEVER use market during pre/after hours
      5. Limit orders prevent overpaying

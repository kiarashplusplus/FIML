      When you're ready to buy or sell a stock, you have choices in HOW you execute that trade. 
      The two most common order types are **market orders** and **limit orders**. 
      
      Understanding the difference can save you money and help you get better prices!
      
      Think of it like shopping:
      - **Market Order**: "I'll buy it right now at whatever the current price is"
      - **Limit Order**: "I'll only buy it if the price drops to $X or lower"

      **📊 Market Order**
      
      A market order executes immediately at the best available price.
      
      ✅ **Pros:**
      - Guaranteed execution (almost always fills)
      - Fast and simple
      - No waiting
      
      ❌ **Cons:**
      - You don't control the exact price
      - Can get a worse price than expected (slippage)
      - Risky for volatile stocks
      
      **Example:**
      You place a market order to buy AAPL. Current ask is $150.00.
      - Your order executes at $150.05 (someone else bought first)
      - You got "slippage" of $0.05

      **🎯 Limit Order**
      
      A limit order only executes at your specified price or better.
      
      ✅ **Pros:**
      - You control the maximum price you pay (or minimum you receive)
      - No unpleasant surprises
      - Better for volatile stocks
      
      ❌ **Cons:**
      - May never execute if price doesn't reach your limit
      - Could miss the trade entirely
      - Requires patience
      
      **Example:**
      You place a limit order to buy AAPL at $149.50 (current price: $150.00).
      - Your order sits and waits
      - If price drops to $149.50 → executes
      - If price rises to $155 → order never fills

      **Live Example with {symbol}:**
      
      Current Bid: ${bid}
      Current Ask: ${ask}
      
      **Market Buy Order:**
      - You'd pay: ${ask} (immediately)
      - Execution: Instant
      
      **Limit Buy Order at ${limit_price}:**
      - You'd pay: ${limit_price} (if it reaches this level)
      - Execution: Only if ask drops to ${limit_price} or lower
      
      **Which to use?**
      - Need shares NOW → Market Order
      - Willing to wait for a better price → Limit Order

      🎯 **Key Takeaways:**
      
      1. **Market Order** = Speed & certainty of execution (but not price)
      2. **Limit Order** = Control over price (but not execution)
      3. Use market orders for highly liquid stocks when speed matters
      4. Use limit orders for volatile stocks or when price matters more than timing
      5. Never use market orders during pre-market or after-hours (low liquidity)
      
      💡 **Pro Tip:** For large orders, limit orders help avoid moving the market against you!

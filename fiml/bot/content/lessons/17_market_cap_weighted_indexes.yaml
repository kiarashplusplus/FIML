      When you invest in the S&P 500 through an index fund, are you equally invested in all 500 companies?
      
      **No!** The S&P 500 is **market-cap weighted**, meaning:
      - Bigger companies = bigger slice of your investment
      - Smaller companies = smaller slice
      
      Apple alone can be ~7% of your "500-stock portfolio"!
      
      Is this good or bad? Let's explore how index weighting works and what it means for your money.

    title: "How Market-Cap Weighting Works"
    content: |
      **The Formula:**
      
      Each stock's weight = (Its market cap) / (Total market cap of all stocks)
      
      **Example S&P 500 Breakdown (simplified):**
      
      If total S&P 500 market cap = $40 trillion
      
      Apple market cap = $3 trillion
      Apple weight = $3T / $40T = 7.5% of the index
      
      Small company market cap = $20 billion  
      Small company weight = $20B / $40T = 0.05% of the index
      
      **What This Means:**
      - Every $100 you invest → $7.50 goes to Apple
      - Every $100 you invest → $0.05 goes to small company
      - Apple has 150x more influence than the small company!
      
      **The Top 10 Reality:**
      In the S&P 500, the top 10 stocks often represent 25-30% of the entire index.
      
      You're not equally diversified—you're heavily concentrated in mega-caps!

      Let's look at actual index concentration using live data:
      
      {fiml_data_index_weights}
      
      Notice:
      - Technology stocks dominate
      - Top holdings change over time
      - Your "diversified" index fund has concentration risk
      
      This isn't bad—these companies got big for a reason! But it's important to understand.

    title: "Market-Cap vs Equal-Weight Indexes"
    content: |
      **Market-Cap Weighted (Standard):**
      - Examples: S&P 500 (SPY), Total Market (VTI)
      - Bigger companies = bigger impact
      - Pros:
        * Mirrors overall market
        * Lower turnover (automatic rebalancing)
        * Tax efficient
        * Winners keep winning
      - Cons:
        * Concentration in mega-caps
        * Buying more of what's already expensive
        * Less exposure to smaller stocks
      
      **Equal-Weight:**
      - Examples: S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP)
      - All 500 stocks get 0.2% each (1/500)
      - Pros:
        * True diversification across all stocks
        * More exposure to smaller companies
        * Value tilt (buy what's cheaper)
      - Cons:
        * Higher turnover (frequent rebalancing)
        * Higher fees
        * May lag in strong bull markets
      
      **Historical Performance:**
      Over long periods, equal-weight often outperforms market-cap weighted, but with higher volatility!

    title: "The Concentration Question"
    content: |
      **Is Concentration Bad?**
      
      Not necessarily! Here's why:
      
      ✅ **Why It's Okay:**
      - Big companies got big by being successful
      - Reflects market's collective wisdom
      - Low-cost way to own the winners
      - Automatic portfolio adjustment
      
      ⚠️ **When It's Risky:**
      - If top 10 stocks are in a bubble
      - If you own multiple similar index funds
      - If you have no international exposure
      - If tech sector crashes
      
      **Real-World Example:**
      In 2000, tech stocks were 30%+ of S&P 500
      Tech crashed 2000-2002
      S&P 500 fell 49% (concentration risk realized!)
      
      **The Solution:**
      - Know what you own (check your fund's top holdings)
      - Consider equal-weight or sector funds for balance
      - International diversification
      - Don't fight the market, but be aware of concentration

    title: "Remember"
    points:
      - "Market-cap weighted = bigger companies get bigger slice"
      - "S&P 500 top 10 stocks = ~25-30% of the index"
      - "You're not equally invested in all 500 stocks"
      - "Equal-weight indexes spread money evenly but cost more"
      - "Concentration isn't bad, but be aware of it"
      - "Check your index fund's top holdings regularly"

    - id: market_cap_weight_definition
      type: multiple_choice
      text: "In a market-cap weighted index, what determines how much of the index each stock represents?"
      options:
        - "All stocks get equal weight"
        - "Stocks are weighted by price"
        - "Stocks are weighted by market capitalization"
        - "Stocks are randomly weighted"
      correct: 2
      explanation: "Market-cap weighted means each stock's weight equals its market cap divided by total index market cap. Bigger companies = bigger slice of your investment."

      type: multiple_choice
      text: "If you invest $1,000 in the S&P 500 and Apple is 7% of the index, how much goes to Apple?"
      options:
        - "$2 (since 500 stocks = $2 each)"
        - "$70 (7% of $1,000)"
        - "$14 (1/500th of $1,000)"
        - "$100 (equal weight)"
      correct: 1
      explanation: "7% of $1,000 = $70. In market-cap weighted indexes, larger companies get proportionally more of your investment. You're NOT equally invested in all 500 stocks!"

    - id: equal_weight_vs_market_cap
      type: true_false
      text: "True or False: Equal-weight indexes give every stock the same amount of money, regardless of company size."
      correct: true
      explanation: "True! Equal-weight indexes (like RSP for S&P 500) invest the same amount in each stock. If there are 500 stocks, each gets 0.2% (1/500). This provides true diversification but requires frequent rebalancing."

    - id: concentration_risk
      type: multiple_choice
      text: "What is the main risk of market-cap weighted indexes like the S&P 500?"
      options:
        - "Too many small companies"
        - "Equal exposure to all sectors"
        - "Concentration in a few mega-cap stocks"
        - "Not enough technology stocks"
      correct: 2
      explanation: "The main risk is concentration—the top 10 stocks often make up 25-30% of the index. If these mega-caps decline, the entire index suffers significantly."

      How It Works:
      
      S&P 500 example:
      - Apple (7% of index)
      - Microsoft (6%)
      - Tiny company (0.01%)
      
      Math:
      If Apple rises 10%, index rises ~0.7%
      If tiny company rises 10%, index barely moves
      
      Top 10 Stocks:
      Make up ~30% of S&P 500
      
      Pros:
      ✅ Self-rebalancing (winners naturally grow)
      ✅ Low turnover = low fees
      ✅ Reflects market consensus
      
      Cons:
      ❌ Concentrated in mega-caps
      ❌ Can create bubbles
      ❌ Buys high, sells low (adds winners)
      
      Alternative: Equal Weight:
      Every stock gets same %
      More balanced, higher returns historically

      🎯 Remember:
      
      1. Market-cap = bigger companies, bigger weight
      2. S&P 500 = cap-weighted
      3. Top 10 = ~30% of S&P 500
      4. Creates concentration risk
      5. Equal-weight is alternative

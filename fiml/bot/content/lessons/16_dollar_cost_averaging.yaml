      Imagine you have $12,000 to invest. Should you invest it all at once, or spread it out over time?
      
      **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)** is the strategy of investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions.
      
      Instead of investing $12,000 today, you might invest $1,000 per month for 12 months.
      
      Why would you do this? Let's find out!

    title: "How Dollar-Cost Averaging Works"
    content: |
      **The Mechanics:**
      
      With DCA, you invest the same dollar amount on a regular schedule:
      - Weekly, monthly, or quarterly
      - Regardless of whether markets are up or down
      - Automatically or manually
      
      **The Math:**
      
      When prices are HIGH → Your fixed $$ buys FEWER shares
      When prices are LOW → Your fixed $$ buys MORE shares
      
      Result: Your average cost per share is lower than the average price!
      
      **Example:**
      Month 1: $100 buys 2 shares at $50 each
      Month 2: $100 buys 5 shares at $20 each  
      Month 3: $100 buys 3.33 shares at $30 each
      
      Total: $300 bought 10.33 shares
      Average price: ($50+$20+$30)/3 = $33.33
      Your cost: $300/10.33 = $29.04 per share ✅
      
      You paid LESS than the average price!

    title: "DCA vs. Lump Sum: The Debate"
    content: |
      **Lump Sum Advantages:**
      - ✅ Historically better returns (time in market beats timing)
      - ✅ Immediate full exposure to growth
      - ✅ No cash drag (uninvested money earns nothing)
      
      **DCA Advantages:**
      - ✅ Reduces regret if you invest right before a crash
      - ✅ Psychologically easier during volatility
      - ✅ Enforces discipline (prevents emotional decisions)
      - ✅ Practical for most people (investing from salary)
      
      **The Research:**
      Vanguard found lump sum outperforms DCA about 2/3 of the time.
      
      BUT: DCA wins on risk-adjusted returns and peace of mind.
      
      **The Reality:**
      Most people don't have a lump sum to invest anyway! They invest from their paycheck each month—that's DCA by default.

      Let's see how DCA would perform with real market data.
      
      Imagine you invested $500/month in {symbol} over the past year:
      
      {fiml_data_dca_simulation}
      
      Notice how:
      - You bought more shares when price dropped
      - You bought fewer shares when price rose
      - Your average cost smoothed out volatility
      
      This is DCA protecting you from bad timing!

    title: "When DCA Makes the Most Sense"
    content: |
      **Best Use Cases:**
      
      1. **Regular Savings:** Investing part of each paycheck
         - 401(k) contributions = DCA
         - Monthly brokerage transfers = DCA
      
      2. **High Volatility:** When markets are choppy
         - Reduces chance of buying at peak
         - Takes advantage of dips automatically
      
      3. **Emotional Comfort:** If you fear market timing
         - Removes decision paralysis
         - "Set and forget" approach
      
      4. **Large Inheritance:** When you have a lump sum
         - Spread over 6-12 months to reduce regret
         - Balance peace of mind vs optimal returns
      
      **When NOT to Use DCA:**
      - Emergency fund (need it liquid)
      - Short-term goals (< 3 years)
      - After extensive research if you're confident
      
      **The Bottom Line:**
      Perfect is the enemy of good. DCA gets you invested consistently, and that beats trying to time the market!

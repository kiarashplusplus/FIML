      How It Works:
      
      Invest $500/month for 6 months
      
      Month 1: $50/share → buy 10 shares
      Month 2: $40/share → buy 12.5 shares
      Month 3: $60/share → buy 8.3 shares
      
      Total: 30.8 shares
      Average cost: ~$48.70/share
      
      vs Lump Sum:
      Invest $3,000 at once in Month 1
      $50/share → 60 shares
      
      Benefits:
      
      ✅ Removes emotion/timing stress
      ✅ Automatic discipline
      ✅ Lowers average cost in volatile markets
      ✅ Easier to start (don't need big sum)
      
      Downsides:
      
      ❌ In rising markets, lump sum wins
      ❌ Miss potential early gains
      
      When to Use:
      - You get paid monthly
      - Market is volatile
      - You're risk-averse
      - You're a beginner

      **"Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."**  
      - Warren Buffett
      
      Markets are driven by two primary emotions:
      
      **GREED** (Euphoria, FOMO):
      "This stock will go up forever! I need to buy NOW!"
      → Result: Buying at tops, overpaying, bubbles
      
      **FEAR** (Panic, Despair):
      "Everything is crashing! I need to sell NOW!"
      → Result: Selling at bottoms, missing recoveries
      
      The best investors recognize these emotions in themselves AND in the market, 
      then act rationally despite them.

      **🎯 Mastering Your Emotions:**
      
      **Strategy #1: Have a Plan Before Emotions Hit**
      - Set entry and exit points BEFORE buying
      - Use limit orders, not market orders
      - Define stop losses in advance
      - "If price reaches X, I will do Y"
      
      **Strategy #2: Use a Checklist**
      Before every trade, ask:
      - [ ] Have I researched this thoroughly?
      - [ ] Is my position size appropriate (1-2% risk)?
      - [ ] Do I have a stop loss set?
      - [ ] Am I buying based on FOMO?
      - [ ] Would I buy this if I had cash today?
      
      **Strategy #3: Zoom Out**
      - Look at 5-year charts, not 5-minute
      - What will matter in 10 years?
      - Is this really a crisis or just volatility?
      
      **Strategy #4: Automate**
      - DCA: Buy same amount every month
      - Rebalancing: Sell winners, buy losers quarterly
      - Removes emotion from equation
      
      **Strategy #5: Accept Volatility**
      - Stocks go down 10-20% every year (normal)
      - Bear markets happen every 3-5 years
      - Price is what you pay, value is what you get

      Every second, millions of trades happen across global stock markets. But what exactly 
      determines a stock's price? 
      
      A stock price represents the current market value of one share of a company. It's the 
      price at which buyers and sellers agree to exchange ownership. Unlike a product in a 
      store with a fixed price tag, stock prices constantly fluctuate based on supply and demand.
      
      Think of it like an auction: when more people want to buy a stock (high demand), the 
      price goes up. When more people want to sell (high supply), the price goes down.

      Let's look at a real stock right now: {symbol}
      
      Current Price: ${price}
      Bid (highest buy offer): ${bid}
      Ask (lowest sell offer): ${ask}
      Spread: ${spread}
      
      The "bid" is what buyers are willing to pay right now.
      The "ask" is what sellers are demanding right now.
      The "spread" is the difference between them.

      **Why the Bid-Ask Spread Matters:**
      
      The spread represents the cost of executing a trade instantly. If you want to buy 
      immediately, you pay the ask price. If you want to sell immediately, you receive the bid price.
      
      📊 **Spread Size Indicates:**
      - **Narrow spread** (< $0.10): Highly liquid stock, easy to trade
      - **Wide spread** (> $0.50): Less liquid, harder to trade at good prices
      
      **Example:**
      - Bid: $100.00
      - Ask: $100.05
      - Spread: $0.05
      
      If you buy at $100.05 and immediately sell at $100.00, you lose $0.05 per share!

      🎯 **Key Takeaways:**
      
      1. Stock prices are determined by supply and demand, not company decisions
      2. Bid = highest price buyers will pay right now
      3. Ask = lowest price sellers will accept right now
      4. The spread is your "cost of entry" for instant trades
      5. Narrow spreads indicate high liquidity and easier trading
      
      💡 **Remember:** The price you see quoted is usually the last traded price, which may 
      differ from the current bid or ask!

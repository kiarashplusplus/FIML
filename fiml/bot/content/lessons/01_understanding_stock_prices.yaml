      Stock price = what buyers and sellers agree on RIGHT NOW.
      It changes every second based on supply and demand.
      
      More buyers = price up
      More sellers = price down

      Three Key Prices:
      
      1. BID = highest price buyers will pay
      2. ASK = lowest price sellers accept
      3. SPREAD = difference (Ask - Bid)
      
      Example:
      Bid: $100.00
      Ask: $100.05
      Spread: $0.05
      
      Why Spread Matters:
      - Buy at ask ($100.05)
      - Sell at bid ($100.00)
      - Instant loss: $0.05 per share!
      
      Narrow spread (< $0.10) = good liquidity
      Wide spread (> $0.50) = poor liquidity

      🎯 Remember:
      
      1. Stock prices reflect supply/demand, not company control
      2. Bid = what buyers pay
      3. Ask = what sellers want
      4. Spread = your trading cost
      5. Narrow spreads = easier trading

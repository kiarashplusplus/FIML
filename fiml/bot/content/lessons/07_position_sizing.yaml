      The 5% Rule:
      
      Never put >5% of portfolio in one stock
      
      $10,000 portfolio → max $500 per stock
      
      Why:
      - One bad pick won't destroy you
      - Forces diversification
      - Reduces emotional attachment
      
      Position Sizing Strategies:
      
      Equal Weight:
      - Same $ amount each stock
      - Simple, balanced
      
      Risk-Based:
      - Smaller positions for risky stocks
      - Larger for stable stocks
      
      Conviction-Based:
      - More $ in high-conviction picks
      - Less in speculative plays

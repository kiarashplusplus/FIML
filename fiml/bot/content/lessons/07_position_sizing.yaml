      One of the biggest mistakes new investors make: putting too much money in one stock.
      
      Imagine having $10,000 and buying $9,000 worth of one stock. If it drops 20%, you've 
      lost $1,800 (18% of your total portfolio). Ouch!
      
      **Position sizing** determines how much to invest in each stock to manage risk effectively.
      
      The golden rule: **Never risk more than 1-2% of your portfolio on a single trade.**

      **📊 The 1-2% Risk Rule:**
      
      **What it means:**
      No single trade should risk losing more than 1-2% of your total portfolio.
      
      **Example with $10,000 portfolio:**
      - 1% risk = Maximum $100 loss per trade
      - 2% risk = Maximum $200 loss per trade
      
      **How to calculate:**
      1. Decide your max risk per trade (1-2% of portfolio)
      2. Set your stop-loss level
      3. Calculate position size
      
      **Formula:**
      Position Size = (Portfolio × Risk %) ÷ (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price)
      
      **Real Example:**
      - Portfolio: $10,000
      - Risk per trade: 2% = $200
      - Stock price: $100
      - Stop loss: $95 (5% below entry)
      - Loss per share if stopped out: $5
      
      Position Size = $200 ÷ $5 = 40 shares
      Investment = 40 shares × $100 = $4,000 (40% of portfolio, but only 2% at risk!)

      **🎯 Position Sizing Guidelines:**
      
      **Aggressive (Higher Risk):**
      - Risk: 2-3% per trade
      - Max single position: 15-20% of portfolio
      - Suitable for: Experienced traders, higher risk tolerance
      - Downside: Larger drawdowns possible
      
      **Moderate (Balanced):**
      - Risk: 1-2% per trade
      - Max single position: 8-12% of portfolio
      - Suitable for: Most investors
      - Best balance of growth and protection
      
      **Conservative (Lower Risk):**
      - Risk: 0.5-1% per trade
      - Max single position: 5-8% of portfolio
      - Suitable for: Beginners, low risk tolerance, retirement accounts
      - Downside: Slower growth
      
      **Number of Positions:**
      - Minimum: 8-10 stocks (for diversification)
      - Maximum: 20-30 stocks (too many = hard to manage)
      - Sweet spot: 12-20 stocks across sectors

      **⚠️ Common Position Sizing Mistakes:**
      
      **1. Equal Dollar Amounts**
      ❌ Putting $1,000 in every stock regardless of risk
      ✅ Adjust size based on volatility and conviction
      
      **2. Over-Concentration**
      ❌ 50% of portfolio in one "sure thing"
      ✅ Even the best stocks can crash
      - Enron was once a blue-chip
      - Nokia dominated phones
      - Kodak invented digital cameras (but failed)
      
      **3. Ignoring Correlation**
      ❌ 10 different tech stocks = not diversified!
      ✅ Spread across sectors and asset classes
      
      **4. Revenge Trading**
      ❌ Doubling down after a loss to "get even"
      ✅ Stick to your system regardless of emotion
      
      **5. No Stop Losses**
      ❌ "I'll hold forever, it will come back"
      ✅ Hope is not a strategy—protect your capital
